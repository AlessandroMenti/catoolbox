# Requesting support
Since (at the time of writing) there are no discussion boards, should you have
any questions, just send an e-mail to @AlessandroMenti (his address is in [his
GitHub profile](https://github.com/AlessandroMenti)). *Please note that, since
his free time is extremely limited, it might take him some time to reply.*

**Please do not file an issue to ask a question**; use the bug tracker only for
bug reports and feature requests.
